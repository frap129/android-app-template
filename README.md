# Android App Template
A staring point for creating a new android app repo, with many tools and patterns for modern Android development already implemented, such as:

- Compose
- Jetpack Navigation
	- Made more modular using [Destinations](core/ui/src/main/java/dev/maples/template/ui/model/data/Destination.kt)
	- Deep link support
- Koin dependency injection
- ktlint and EditorConfig for code style
- Timber for logging
- Multi-module project structure
- Gradle convention plugins to simplify creating new:
	-  App modules
	- Library modules
	- Modules with Compose 
	- Modules with Android Hidden Api access

And more to come

Check out the `example` branch for some simple implementations of modules.
